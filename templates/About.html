        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>Our team created Eventsly because in the past, there was no easy way for you to search for and locate events in your communities. We know every community has something unique and special to offer. We also know that there are exciting events happening all around us. However, in the past, learning about and locationing these events was challenging and seemingly impossible.</p>
        <p>Existing websites would only highlight popular attractions and tourist destinations. They didnâ€™t provide information about events happening in local communities, or how to locate them. Noticing this void has motivated us to create a simple solution making discovering and locating events in your community as easy as possible. Our ultimate goal is to help you connect with your community.</p>
